## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

The planner decides how a record changes the subject's profile. A language model proposes add, replace and remove
steps through tools; the planner builds them into a plan in memory and writes nothing. This document covers the profile
read port, the numbered profile the model sees, the plan tools with their checks, building the plan with its node keys
and origin, and the agent loop with its caps and drop events. The prompt, the hand-off from intake and the rerun on a
write conflict follow in later changes.

### 1.2 Purpose

Construct keeps one consistent profile per subject and avoids contradicting facts (`cpt-cf-construct-fr-fact-decisions`).
The model works on numbered values and plain property names, never on IDs
(`cpt-cf-construct-principle-model-never-sees-ids`). The tools refuse a call that breaks a rule and tell the model
why, so the plan holds only steps that fit the person types.

**Out of scope**: the prompt, beyond a short instruction; the hand-off from Record Intake and the
processing chain; the rerun on a write conflict; skipping a fact under an open review request (Review Queue); the
graph storage implementation of the profile read.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-construct-fr-fact-decisions`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-construct-principle-model-never-sees-ids`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-construct-actor-llm-gateway` | The model behind the model client. It sees the numbered profile and calls the plan tools. |
| `cpt-cf-construct-actor-graph-storage` | Holds the profile the planner reads. |

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

**Use cases**: None in this part. The planner is internal; the flow from a received record comes with the hand-off.

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Read the Profile

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-read-profile`

1. [ ] - `p1` - The planner works on the subject's current profile and its version, read from graph storage, not
   through the Profile Reader or the writer. The read itself comes with the change that reads graph storage -
   `inst-read-source`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Each fact comes with its node key, its category, its property and its value. The version is the root
   node's version, which the planner carries as an opaque value into the plan - `inst-read-facts`

### Show the Profile to the Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-numbered-profile`

1. [ ] - `p1` - Each fact is one line: `n. property (category): value`, numbered from 1 in the order of the read -
   `inst-number-lines`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Every value is shown as compact JSON, a text value as a JSON string, so a line break in a value cannot
   start a line that looks like another value - `inst-number-values`
3. [ ] - `p1` - The model never sees a node key, a tenant or subject id, a type id or the fact's origin - `inst-number-no-ids`

### Plan Tools

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-tools`

1. [ ] - `p1` - Three tools: `add(property, value, confidence)`, `replace(number, value, confidence)` and
   `remove(number, confidence)`. They only add steps to the plan in memory - `inst-tools-set`
2. [ ] - `p1` - `add` offers every property of the person types by name. The property decides the category -
   `inst-tools-properties`
3. [ ] - `p1` - A value is checked against its property's schema in the person type. A refusal names the broken rule
   and the schema the property takes - `inst-tools-value`
4. [ ] - `p1` - A number must name a value of the profile, and only one step may use it - `inst-tools-number`
5. [ ] - `p1` - A property that holds one value takes no second one: an `add` is refused while the profile holds an
   untouched value of it, with "use replace n", or while the plan already adds or replaces one. After a `remove` of
   the old value, an `add` is allowed - `inst-tools-cardinality`
6. [ ] - `p1` - A value already held is refused: an `add` of a value the profile holds under the same property, an
   `add` of a value the plan already writes there, and a `replace` with the value the fact already has. Text is
   compared without case and surrounding spaces - `inst-tools-duplicate`
7. [ ] - `p1` - `replace` takes the complete new value: fields left out of an object are gone - `inst-tools-replace`
8. [ ] - `p1` - Confidence is a number from 0 to 1 - `inst-tools-confidence`
9. [ ] - `p1` - A refused call adds no step; the model gets the refusal's text as the tool result - `inst-tools-refusal`

### Build the Plan

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-build`

1. [ ] - `p1` - Each number maps back to its node key - `inst-build-keys`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Each new value gets a new node key, `construct:{tenant id}:{random UUID}`, also a value that returns
   after a delete, because a soft-deleted key cannot be reused - `inst-build-new-keys`
3. [ ] - `p1` - A replace is one step with the old key and a new key, so the old value goes in the same write. A step
   names a key it creates `node_key` and a key it deletes `old_key` - `inst-build-replace`
4. [ ] - `p1` - The plan holds the tenant and the subject, the profile version it was built on and the record it came
   from: the connector, the record type, its provenance and version, and its `observed_at` - `inst-build-origin`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Each step carries the confidence the model gave it - `inst-build-confidence`

### Run the Agent Loop

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-loop`

1. [ ] - `p1` - A record without a subject, or without a readable `observed_at`, is dropped with `processing_failed`
   before any model call - `inst-loop-record`
2. [ ] - `p1` - The first request holds the instruction, the record's payload and the numbered profile, and offers the
   three tools - `inst-loop-input`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Each round sends the conversation so far. The model's tool calls go into the plan draft, and each call
   gets its result or its refusal back as a tool result - `inst-loop-round`
4. [ ] - `p1` - An answer without tool calls ends the loop, and the plan is built - `inst-loop-done`
5. [ ] - `p1` - The tokens of every call add up. Past the token cap, the record is dropped with `token_cap` -
   `inst-loop-token-cap`
6. [ ] - `p1` - When the last allowed round still ends in tool calls, the record is dropped with `round_cap` -
   `inst-loop-round-cap`
7. [ ] - `p1` - A failed model call drops the record with `model_failed`; the model error is logged without any
   content - `inst-loop-model-failed`
8. [ ] - `p1` - A drop is a `DropEvent` through `IntakeEvents`, in the shape Record Intake owns, and no plan comes out
   - `inst-loop-drop`

## 4. States (CDSL)

None. A plan lives in memory for one planning run.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Numbered Profile

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-dod-planner-numbered-profile`

The system **MUST** show the profile as numbered values of plain properties, and **MUST NOT** show an ID.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-numbered-profile`

**Touches**:
- Code: `domain::planner::draft::PlanDraft`

**Verified by**: `the_profile_is_shown_as_numbered_values_of_plain_properties_in_json`,
`a_line_break_in_a_value_cannot_forge_a_profile_line` and `the_model_input_holds_no_id`.

### Plan Tools

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-dod-planner-tools`

The system **MUST** offer the add, replace and remove tools, and **MUST** refuse a call that breaks a rule without
adding a step.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-tools`

**Touches**:
- Code: `domain::planner::draft::PlanDraft::apply`, `domain::planner::tools`, `domain::planner::catalog::PropertyCatalog`

**Verified by**: one test per refusal in `domain::planner::draft_test`, each checking that the draft did not change,
and the catalog tests.

### Plan Building

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-dod-planner-plan`

The system **MUST** map numbers to node keys, give each new value a new key in the tenant, and fill the plan's origin
and profile version.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-build`

**Touches**:
- Code: `domain::planner::build`, `domain::plan`

**Verified by**: `a_replace_is_one_step_with_the_old_key_and_a_new_one`,
`an_add_and_a_remove_keep_their_confidence_in_a_plan_on_the_profile_version`,
`every_new_value_gets_its_own_new_key_also_when_it_returns`, `the_record_origin_comes_from_the_received_record` and
`a_record_without_a_readable_observed_at_has_no_origin`.

### Agent Loop

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-dod-planner-loop`

The system **MUST** run the model in rounds until it answers without tool calls, **MUST** stop at the round and token
caps, and **MUST** drop the record with a content-free event and no plan when a cap is hit or the model call fails.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-loop`

**Touches**:
- Code: `domain::planner::agent::Planner`, `domain::record_intake::DropCause`, `infra::intake_events`,
  `config::PlannerConfig`

**Verified by**: `the_tool_calls_of_each_round_become_the_plan`,
`a_refused_tool_call_goes_back_to_the_model_as_the_tool_result`,
`the_model_gets_the_record_and_the_numbered_profile_but_no_id`,
`each_failure_drops_the_record_with_its_cause_and_no_plan`, `the_round_cap_stops_the_loop_after_its_last_round`,
`each_planner_cause_is_logged_by_its_name` and the config test `the_planner_caps_are_read_and_a_typo_is_rejected`.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For a record and a profile, the planner builds a plan of add, replace and remove steps with node keys, the
      profile version and the record's origin.
- [ ] No message or tool result sent to the model holds an ID.
- [ ] A tool call that breaks a rule is refused with a reason, and the plan does not change.
- [ ] A loop that hits a cap, or a failed model call, drops the record with a content-free event and gives no plan.

## 7. Non-Functional Considerations

- **Privacy**: the numbered profile and the record reach the configured model service through the model client. The
  planner logs neither.
- **Caps**: `planner.max_rounds` is 10 and `planner.max_tokens` is 50 000 by default, the sum of input and output
  tokens of all rounds. A record usually needs one to three rounds: tool calls, then an answer. Ten rounds leave room for
  the refusals the model has to correct and still end a loop that never answers. Each round sends the whole
  conversation again, so the token cap is sized for ten rounds over the instructions and a large profile.
- **Plan type**: `domain::plan` holds the tenant and the subject, the record the plan came from, the profile version
  and the steps.
