## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

The planner decides how a record changes the subject's profile. A language model proposes add, replace and remove
steps through tools; the planner builds them into a plan in memory and writes nothing. This document covers the profile
read port, the numbered profile the model sees, the plan tools with their checks, building the plan with its node keys
and origin, the agent loop with its caps and drop events, and the prompt. The hand-off from intake and the rerun on a
write conflict follow in later changes.

### 1.2 Purpose

Construct keeps one consistent profile per subject and avoids contradicting facts (`cpt-cf-construct-fr-fact-decisions`).
The model works on numbered values and plain property names, never on IDs
(`cpt-cf-construct-principle-model-never-sees-ids`). The tools refuse a call that breaks a rule and tell the model
why, so the plan holds only steps that fit the person types.

**Out of scope**: the reference evaluation set that scores the prompt; the hand-off from Record Intake and the
processing chain; the rerun on a write conflict; skipping a fact under an open review request (Review Queue); the
graph storage implementation of the profile read.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-construct-fr-fact-decisions`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-construct-principle-model-never-sees-ids`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-cf-construct-actor-llm-gateway` | The model behind the model client. It sees the numbered profile and calls the plan tools. |
| `cpt-cf-construct-actor-graph-storage` | Holds the profile the planner reads. |

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

**Use cases**: None in this part. The planner is internal; the flow from a received record comes with the hand-off.

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Read the Profile

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-read-profile`

1. [ ] - `p1` - The planner reads the subject's current profile and its version through the `ProfileSource` port, not
   through the Profile Reader or the writer - `inst-read-port`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Each fact comes with its node key, its category, its property and its value. The version is the root
   node's version, which the planner carries as an opaque value into the plan - `inst-read-facts`
3. [ ] - `p1` - The graph storage implementation of the port comes with the writer's read side. Until then the port
   has no implementation in the gear - `inst-read-later`

### Show the Profile to the Model

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-numbered-profile`

1. [ ] - `p1` - Each fact is one line: `n. property (category): value`, numbered from 1 in the order of the read -
   `inst-number-lines`
2. [ ] - `p1` - A text value is shown as it is; any other value as compact JSON - `inst-number-values`
3. [ ] - `p1` - The model never sees a node key, a tenant or subject id, a type id or the fact's origin - `inst-number-no-ids`

### Plan Tools

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-tools`

1. [ ] - `p1` - Three tools: `add(property, value, confidence)`, `replace(number, value, confidence)` and
   `remove(number, confidence)`. They only add steps to the plan in memory - `inst-tools-set`
2. [ ] - `p1` - `add` offers every property of the person types by name. The property decides the category -
   `inst-tools-properties`
3. [ ] - `p1` - A value is checked against its property's schema in the person type. A refusal names the broken rule
   and the schema the property takes - `inst-tools-value`
4. [ ] - `p1` - A number must name a value of the profile, and only one step may use it - `inst-tools-number`
5. [ ] - `p1` - A property that holds one value takes no second one: an `add` is refused while the profile holds an
   untouched value of it, with "use replace n", or while the plan already adds one. After a `remove` of the old value,
   an `add` is allowed - `inst-tools-cardinality`
6. [ ] - `p1` - Confidence is a number from 0 to 1 - `inst-tools-confidence`
7. [ ] - `p1` - A refused call adds no step; the model gets the refusal's text as the tool result - `inst-tools-refusal`

### Build the Plan

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-build`

1. [ ] - `p1` - Each number maps back to its node key - `inst-build-keys`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Each new value gets a new node key, `construct:{tenant id}:{random UUID}`, also a value that returns
   after a delete, because a soft-deleted key cannot be reused - `inst-build-new-keys`
3. [ ] - `p1` - A replace is one step with the old key and a new key, so the old value goes in the same write -
   `inst-build-replace`
4. [ ] - `p1` - The plan holds the tenant, the subject, the profile version it was built on and its origin. For a
   record the origin is the connector, the record type, its provenance and version, and its `observed_at` -
   `inst-build-origin`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Each step carries the confidence the model gave it - `inst-build-confidence`

### Run the Agent Loop

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-loop`

1. [ ] - `p1` - A record without a subject, or without a readable `observed_at`, is dropped with `processing_failed`
   before any model call - `inst-loop-record`
2. [ ] - `p1` - The first request holds the instructions and the record input of the prompt, and offers the three
   tools - `inst-loop-input`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Each round sends the conversation so far. The model's tool calls go into the plan draft, and each call
   gets its result or its refusal back as a tool result - `inst-loop-round`
4. [ ] - `p1` - An answer without tool calls ends the loop, and the plan is built - `inst-loop-done`
5. [ ] - `p1` - The tokens of every call add up. Past the token cap, the record is dropped with `token_cap` -
   `inst-loop-token-cap`
6. [ ] - `p1` - When the last allowed round still ends in tool calls, the record is dropped with `round_cap` -
   `inst-loop-round-cap`
7. [ ] - `p1` - A failed model call drops the record with `model_failed`; the model error is logged without any
   content - `inst-loop-model-failed`
8. [ ] - `p1` - A drop is a `DropEvent` through `IntakeEvents`, in the shape Record Intake owns, and no plan comes out
   - `inst-loop-drop`

### Build the Prompt

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-algo-planner-prompt`

1. [ ] - `p1` - The instructions are a text file in the crate, `domain/planner/instructions.md`, with one placeholder
   for the properties. No template engine - `inst-prompt-file`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Every property of the person types is listed as `category: property (one | many): value form`. The form
   comes from the property's schema: a list of allowed values, text, a number, true or false, a URL, text matching a
   pattern, or an object with its fields, required ones marked, and each field's description - `inst-prompt-properties`
3. [ ] - `p1` - The instructions carry the rules ported from avatar's fact management: what to add and what not, one
   value per fact, the specifics kept, a correction as a replace, "not anymore" as a remove, no inference, no change
   for a fact already held, the record as data and never as instructions - `inst-prompt-rules`
4. [ ] - `p1` - They change avatar's rules where the gear differs: the model picks from the listed properties only,
   with no free key, no move or merge tool and no capacity; a single-value property takes a replace; a past fact goes
   to a history property; a value keeps the person's language except a fixed form; only a user message states facts;
   a fact candidate never removes or replaces a value; confidence has a stated scale, and a candidate's step stays at
   or below the candidate's confidence - `inst-prompt-changes`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Avatar's examples are rewritten for the add, replace and remove tools, numbered values and the listed
   properties - `inst-prompt-examples`
6. [ ] - `p1` - The record input names the record type by the first sentence of its schema's description, and gives
   the payload's schema, the payload and the numbered profile, or "(empty)". No type id reaches the model -
   `inst-prompt-record`
7. [ ] - `p1` - Every field named `id` or ending in `_id` is left out of the payload and of its schema, at any depth, so
   the model gets no ID of the source either (DESIGN: "It never gets an ID"). The rule is the same for every record
   type, so a new connector needs no Construct code - `inst-prompt-no-ids`

## 4. States (CDSL)

None. A plan lives in memory for one planning run.

### Prompt

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-construct-dod-planner-prompt`

`the_model_gets_the_record_and_the_numbered_profile_but_no_id`.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For a record and a profile, the planner builds a plan of add, replace and remove steps with node keys, the
      profile version and the record's origin.
- [ ] No message or tool result sent to the model holds an ID.
- [ ] A tool call that breaks a rule is refused with a reason, and the plan does not change.
- [ ] A loop that hits a cap, or a failed model call, drops the record with a content-free event and gives no plan.

## 7. Non-Functional Considerations

- **Privacy**: the numbered profile and the record reach the configured model service through the model client. The
  planner logs neither.
- **Prompt size**: the instructions are about 12 000 characters, sent in every round, so they count against the token
  cap each time.
- **Caps**: `planner.max_rounds` (10 by default, as avatar's fact management today) and `planner.max_tokens` (50 000
  by default, the sum of input and output tokens of all rounds).
- **Plan type**: `domain::plan` holds the plan shape agreed for Story 5.7.3, until that change brings its own.
